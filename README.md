This repository contains a class and some tests.

The class IntervalCombinator in the merge_algorithm.py file contains the method merge,
which merges an Interval list.

The tests in the test_interval file can be run by running pytest.

The time complexity is O(N log(N)) and the space complexity is O(N).
